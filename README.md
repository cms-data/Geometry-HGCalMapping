# Geometry-HGCalMapping

Data files for Geometry/HGCalMapping

The contents are stored under two directories under data:
- CellMaps
  - Si cell mapping: contains the correspondence of geometry location to readout sequence for each different hexaboard type
  - SiPM-on-tile cell mapping: similar as the previous, for the tileboards
- ModuleMaps
  - Module mapping: contains the correspondence between the geometry location of each module and it's indexing in the readout sequence
 A simple, incremental, versioning is used in each directory.
